Readme for the models folder- will have a list of the different types of 
models (a folder for each type just to keep things straight). Optimally,
we make the models a "function" so that we can pair different models 
with different datasets, and don't need to be referencing file paths 
to datasets in these models. A overall script can manage choosing the dataset(s),
model(s), and evaluation methods.

flex_nn_model.py: final "model funciton": generates model based on given number of layers, layer sizes,
dropout rates, activations funcitons, and l2 parameter per layers.
